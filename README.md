## Lessons
- Extend existing React knowledge into client/server component distinction
- Working with and around component hydration
- Using Prisma to abstract database interactions
- Building Prisma schema for ecommerce needs
- Using Prisma generated types to integrate with frontend structures
- Building interactive elements with complex logic, such as zoomable images, for both mouse and touch inputs
- Animating element hovers by manipulating their before/after pseudoelements
- Using Jest for unit testing and exploring edge cases
- Translating manual testing into tangible sequences with Cypress end-to-end testing
- Optimising end-to-end tests and reducing flakiness
- Distinguishing the reponsibilities of unit and end-to-end testing
- Ensuring the app is accessible through manual and automated means
- Using local PostgreSQL databases for development and test data
- Using Auth.js to guard routes and UI with both authentication and authorisation
- Refactoring existing logic and type system to use Zod for unified runtime and compile-time validation

## Demonstrates
- Understanding of ecommerce user flows, including purchase, auth, and simple order management
- Attention to detail in creating an accessible experience, such as with tab press focus "trapping" and "restore"
- Create responsive layouts across many routes in a modular fashion
- Ability to build a usable admin suite to visually interface with the database for product and order management
- Visualisation and understanding of edge cases through Jest and Cypress tests
- Consistent iteration for organisation and maintaining DRY principles
- Ability to integrate 3rd-party solutions (Stripe sandbox mode) for illustrative purchases and refunds
